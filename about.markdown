I started this blog as a way of not only documenting my development in cyber and information security, but also as a place to write down the thoughts in my head.

As I have only just started on my path into cyber security I am open to what my role would be within cyber security, but I know that, along with a my technical knowledge, I have a deep interest in current affairs and political events, so would love to pair this interest with work in cyber security.

Recently I became [CompTIA Security+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security) certified and am now looking to expand that further by passing my [CompTIA Network+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/network) exam.

Outside of pen testing I&#8217;m a massive fan of video games, am always trying to improve my Italian skills and have also been known to do a bit of share dealing (Tesla remains my most successful bet yet).
