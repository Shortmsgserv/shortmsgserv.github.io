Faced with an obscene bill from my Wordpress host, I decided to have a look around and see what else was out there for hosting that might not cost as much. I managed to find <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank" >Github Pages</a>. On the downside I lose some other functionality I had with my Wordpress site, but my hosting costs have reduced to zero; and the functionality of my Wordpress site is probably overkill for a personal blog. 

However, the move isn't just a simple one-click event and it means I'll have to do some tidying up of older posts, so there may be some issues with posts until I've corrected them.
