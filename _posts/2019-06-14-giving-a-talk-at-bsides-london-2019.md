For this years <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="BSides in London (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.securitybsides.org.uk" target="_blank">BSides in London</a> I applied to be able to give a talk as part of the rookie track. I was accepted onto the rookie track with my talk _Using Network Miner To Reconstruct Network Traffic;_ parts of which I previously explained in [one of my blog posts](https://shortmsgserv.co.uk/reconstructing-a-transmitted-file/). The experience certainly involved a lot of nerves, but I have to say the thrill I got after delivering means I would definitely agree to delivering another talk in future.
